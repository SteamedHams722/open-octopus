#### Excel to Json
- Provides a way to convert an Excel file into a json file. It is unique because it is able to handle Excel files with multiple headers.
- Before using, the following considerations should be made:
  - Install all required libraries (ex. xlrd)
  - Store the desired file(s) to convert in the input sub-folder.
